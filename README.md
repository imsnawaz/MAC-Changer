# MAC-Changer
Masks the MAC address to access a device restricted network with valid credentials.
This is implemented in C using system calls. Some networks use MAC filtering 
to prevent unauthorised devices from connecting. This simple C code helps mask 
the MAC address to login to that network if you donâ€™t have the registered 
device with you. This utility is fully functional for every OSX and Linux device.
